# MScThesisPart2_PowerConverterDriver_NucleoF411
Part 2 of 4 of my MSc Thesis project. This repository contains software of power converter driver implemented on STM32F411-Nucleo board used to monitor and control parameters of power converter. This application communicates directly with the touch panel implemented on STM32F469 (see part of 1 of 4 of the project here on  https://github.com/adamchor1992/MScThesisPart1_TouchPanel_STM32F469)

See screens folder for some screenshots/photos of the implemented system
